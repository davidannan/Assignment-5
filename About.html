            I am a graduate with the goal of becoming a software deeveloper.
            I currently practice as a geomatic Engineer in Accra Ghana. <br>
            I am results-oriented, constantly checking in to determine how close or how far away we are and what it will
            take to make it <br> happen.I am an excellent communicator. I mostly pride myself on making sure people have
            the right
            information because it <br> drives better results. Most business issues stem from poor communication, so I
            feel
            responsible for keeping everyone on the <br> same page. <br>
